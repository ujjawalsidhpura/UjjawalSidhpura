### Hello Humans!
<br>
My name is Ujjawal or better let's go with my anglicized name <b>Ujay</b>. I am a <b>Full-stack Developer</b> who reinvented his career, jumping from a 6-year career in Civil Engineering/Facility Management into the wild wild world of coding. I love working with PERN/MERN stack. My favourite scripting language is JS, but I can also code in Ruby, Python and TS if I have to, woot woot.

Apart from coding and making real-life projects, I love to run, bike, yoga (cliche huh), netflixing(if that's even a word).
<br>
I am a coffee connoisseur who likes to explore different coffee joints and do extended coding sessions under the influence of <b>caffeine</b>.
