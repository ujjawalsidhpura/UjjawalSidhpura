### Hello Humans!

My name is Ujjawal (you can call me **usual**) or better let's go with my anglicized name **Ujay**. I am Full-stack Developer who reinvented his career, jumping from a 6 years career in Civil Engineering/Facility Management into to the **wild wild** world of coding. I love working with PERN/MERN stack. My favourite scripting language is **JS**, but I can also code in **Ruby, Python and TS** if I have to, woot woot. Here is the link to my portfolio.

Apart from coding and making real-life projects, I love to run, bike, yoga (cliche huh), netflixing(if that's even a word).
<br>
I am coffee connoisseur who likes to explore different coffee joints and do extended coding sessions under the influence of **caffeine**.
