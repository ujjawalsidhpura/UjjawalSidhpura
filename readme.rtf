Hello!
My name is Ujjawal (you can call me usual) or better let's go with my anglicized name Ujay. I am civil engineer-project manager turned into
an aspiring web developer and data analyst. I have done months of self-taught/Udemy on web-dev and data analytics. Then I joined WebDevelopment bootcamp at 
prestigeous Lighthouse Labs in Toronto. So far, this is my journey.
