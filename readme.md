###Hello!
<br>
My name is Ujjawal (you can call me usual) or better let's go with my anglicized name Ujay. I am civil engineer-project manager turned into a full-stack Developer and Data analyst. I have done months of self-taught/Udemy on web-dev and data analytics.
I got my Diploma in Full stack Web Development from Toronto's prestigeous Lighthouse Labs. Apart from coding and making real-life projects, I love to run and bike.
A coffee connoisseur who likes to explore different coffee joints and then do extended coding sessions.
